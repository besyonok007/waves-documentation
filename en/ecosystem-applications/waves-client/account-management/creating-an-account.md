Waves app will display an important reminder. Never provide your backup phrase to anyone except the official Waves client. We recommend that you write the backup phrase on a piece of paper and store it in a secure location. Do not store the backup phrase unencrypted on any electronic device.

Create several copies of the seed phrase and click on **I've written it down**

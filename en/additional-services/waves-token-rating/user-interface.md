## Account

Tokens can be rated from browsers only with Waves Keeper installed. In mobile browsers, only display of ratings is available.

If Waves Keeper is installed, then in the upper right corner you can see the calculated value of the weight of your rating based on the number of WCT tokens on your account.

The menu consists of following items:

* Account - account information
* Rating - default Token Rating page
* My tokens - the token management panel for issuers
* Log out

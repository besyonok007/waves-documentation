# Mining reward

## Description

On the Waves blockchain, it is proposed to add an additional reward for mining. For each generated block, the miner will be rewarded at WAVES. In the current model, miners earn only transaction fees; their income is less than 1% per annum. The additional fees will increase mining and leasing revenues.

Immediately after the new model is introduced, mining revenue will be 7%.

This new feature includes the release of additional WAVES tokens on the blockchain.

## Reward amount

The proposed initial reward is 5 WAVES for each generated unit. This amount of reward will remain unchanged for 100,000 blocks, i.e. approximately 2.5 months.

The subsequent amount of the reward will be determined by the miners themselves in the voting.

## Voting

Every 100,000 blocks of miners shall vote to increase/decrease the amount of the reward or to keep it unchanged.

As a rule, the cost of changing the reward is 0.5 WAVES. For example, if the current amount of reward is 7 WAVES, and the miners voted to reduce the reward, the new amount of reward will be 6.5 WAVES.

The new amount is valid for the next 100,000 blocks.

The voting process is repeated every 100,000 blocks.

## Introduction

Waves allow you to hold and transfer Waves Enterprise on its blockchain. This works through a so-called Multigateway approach: Waves Enterprise tokens are sent to a user's deposit address available in the Waves wallet and after the deposit the user receives a Waves Enterprise tokens issued in the Waves blockchain. Every single Waves based Waves Enterprise token is backed 1:1 with the Waves Enterprise token from the external network.

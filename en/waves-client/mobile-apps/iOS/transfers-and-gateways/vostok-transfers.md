## Introduction

Waves allow you to hold and transfer Vostok on its blockchain. This works through a so-called Multigateway approach: Vostok tokens are sent to a user's deposit address available in the Waves wallet and after the deposit the user receives a Vostok tokens issued in the Waves blockchain. Every single Waves based Vostok token is backed 1:1 with the Vostok token from the external network.
